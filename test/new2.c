// Write a C program using Pthreads where multiple threads perform work in two phases. All threads must complete Phase 1 before any thread can begin Phase 2.

//     Define a constant NUM_THREADS (e.g., 5).

//     Define shared variables:

//         A counter arrived_count initialized to 0.

//         A mutex barrier_mutex.

//         A condition variable barrier_cond.

//     Create NUM_THREADS threads. Each thread will execute a worker function.

//     The worker function should:

//         Print a message indicating it's starting Phase 1 (include thread ID).

//         Simulate Phase 1 work (e.g., sleep(1) or a short random sleep).

//         Print a message indicating it has finished Phase 1 and is waiting at the barrier.

//         Call a barrier_wait() function (you need to implement this).

//         Print a message indicating it has passed the barrier and is starting Phase 2.

//         Simulate Phase 2 work (e.g., another short sleep or just printing).

//         Print a message indicating it has finished Phase 2.

//     Implement the barrier_wait() function:

//         It should take the total number of threads (NUM_THREADS) as an argument or use the global constant.

//         Inside, lock the barrier_mutex.

//         Increment the arrived_count.

//         Check if the current thread is the last thread to arrive (arrived_count == NUM_THREADS).

//             If it is the last thread: Print a message confirming this, signal all other waiting threads using pthread_cond_broadcast, and then proceed (unlock mutex).

//             If it is not the last thread: Wait on the barrier_cond using pthread_cond_wait. Crucially, the wait should be inside a while loop that checks arrived_count < NUM_THREADS. This handles spurious wakeups and ensures the thread only proceeds when all threads have actually arrived.

//         Unlock the barrier_mutex.

//     The main function should:

//         Initialize the mutex and condition variable.

//         Create the threads.

//         Wait for all threads to complete using pthread_join.

//         Destroy the mutex and condition variable.

//         Print a final message indicating all threads have completed.

// How to Compile:
// gcc your_program_name.c -o your_program_name -pthread

// Explanation & Key Points:

//     Barrier Purpose: To synchronize threads at a specific point, ensuring no thread proceeds past the barrier until all threads have reached it.

//     Shared Counter: arrived_count tracks how many threads have reached the barrier. It's protected by barrier_mutex.

//     Last Thread's Role: The last thread to arrive (arrived_count == total_threads) has the responsibility of waking up all other waiting threads.

//     pthread_cond_broadcast(): This is used instead of pthread_cond_signal() because all waiting threads need to be woken up when the barrier condition is met, not just one.

//     pthread_cond_wait() and the while Loop: As in Problem 2, the while (arrived_count < total_threads) loop around pthread_cond_wait() is essential. Threads wait while the condition to proceed (all threads arrived) is false. This correctly handles spurious wakeups â€“ if a thread wakes up early, it re-checks the condition and goes back to waiting if necessary.

//     Mutex Lock/Unlock: The mutex must be held when checking/modifying arrived_count and when calling pthread_cond_wait or pthread_cond_broadcast. pthread_cond_wait automatically releases and re-acquires the lock.

//     Single Use vs. Reusable: This implementation is primarily for a single barrier use. Making a barrier reusable often requires adding a generation counter or epoch to prevent race conditions where fast threads loop back to the barrier before slow threads have even left the previous wait.

// This barrier problem tests a slightly more complex coordination scenario than the simple wait/signal, requiring the use of pthread_cond_broadcast and careful handling of the wait condition.
